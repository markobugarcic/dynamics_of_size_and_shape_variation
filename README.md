# dynamics_of_size_and_shape_variation
This repository includes R scripts and data for geometric morphometric analyses of morphological variation during embryonic development in _Triturus_ newts. We explored two phases of embryonic development separately. During tailbud phase, we quantified shape fo the whole embryo while during prehatching phase we quantified head shape. Results  are published in [too add upon acceptance].
